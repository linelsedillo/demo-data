The entrance, living room and game room all boast vaulted ceilings with abundant light spilling in from sliding glass doors on the western side of the home. There is a family room, game room, bar, and loft, an office/library with built-ins, and a separate laundry room in this U-Shaped home which wraps around a courtyard.
